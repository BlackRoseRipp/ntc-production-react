        <i>NTC Laboratory Tour?</i>
        <br /> A tour of the National Toxicology Center is provided as an
        introduction to our laboratory facility and focuses on state-of-the-art
        equipment, advanced testing by definitive methods, and toxicologist
        guided interpretive reporting.

        <i>Does Presumptive Drug Screening Make Sense?</i>
        <br /> This webinar draws from our toxicology practice experience at
        National Toxicology Center and demonstrates the clinical value of
        direct-to-definitive drug screening. Drawing from practice experience
        with 5000 pain management and addiction medicine cases the webinar
        graphically presents the extent of therapeutic and illicit drug use in
        this clinical population. With prescription information in all cases the
        study presentation also focuses on the inconsistent positive drug-use
        findings as well as therapeutic non-compliance with prescribed
        medications, especially the psychiatric agents.

        <i>Can Direct-to-Definitive Drug Screening be Performed Routinely?</i><br/> This
        webinar demonstrates the technical advance made at NTC that allow the
        routine and high volume use of direct-to-definitive drug screening. The
        webinar provides a journey through automated sample preparation, rapid
        chromatographic separation, multi-drug MS acquisition, computerized data
        management and interfaced interpretive reporting. The novel method of
        matrix normalization by threshold accurate calibration is shown for
        multi-drug quantitative analysis.
