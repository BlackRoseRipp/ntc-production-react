                A Leader in Definitive Drug Testing by Mass Spectrometry, NTC
                provides definitive results in just 48 hours.&nbsp;

              In 2010, Dr. Thomas Rosano founded the National Toxicology Center
              (NTC) to advance the practice of clinical and forensic toxicology.
              Early research at NTC lead to development of an innovative method
              for definitive monitoring of drugs by mass spectrometry. The
              method has pioneering a direct-to-definitive testing approach that
              eliminates the false-positive and false negative results of
              traditional drug screening by immunoassay.

              We are also a leader in alcohol monitoring.&nbsp;We test for
              alcohol metabolites (Ethylglucuronide &ndash; ETG), which extends
              the window of detection to several days &amp; eliminate false
              positives.&nbsp;&nbsp;
